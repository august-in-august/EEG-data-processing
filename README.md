# EEG-data-processing

## Purpose
- Program to preprocess EEG(electroencephalogram) data (.edf format) which obtained from Biopac to get reletie power of each raw data.
- Reduce time effort for EEG data processing, mainly noise rejection and formatting
    - Previous workflow:
  > Obtain data from acqKnowledge -> convert .acq EEG data to .edf format -> import raw data to eeglab (do preprocessing) -> downsampling rate -> IIR filtering, Notch noise filtering -> capture ECG pattern (noise) -> reject ECG noise from EEG data -> auto rejection with ASR algorithm -> export temp data -> process with software to get absolute power and relative band power for each data channel
    - Simpliszed workflow:
  > Obtain data from acqKnowledge -> convert to .edf format -> run program -> get result


## Requirements:
Use acqKnoledge software to obtain data from Biopac EEG 100 device.

- data requirements
  > [.edf](https://www.edfplus.info/) format EEG data
  > data channle: not limited, same with [MNE package](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html)

## Program guide

### Run compiled program directly
Download main_GUI_ALL.zip, unzip and click main_GUI_ALL.exe to execute program
Click browser to select target file folder, program will recognise edf files automatically
- Select a single file to preview result, save result to local disk.
- Process all edf data under current selected folder.

All processed results will appear under current selected folder with separate folder named after file name
- .png *Results of absolute and relative power of selected data*
- .edf *edf data file after preprocessing, can be use as further aims*
- .set *convert edf after preprocessing as a dataset of eeglab program, for further processing, you can import .set to **eeglab** directly and make use of that set file, for example, for further manual noise rejection
-  when process all data under folder, program will generate extra two xlxs files
   - absolute_power.xlsx *absolute results for all data processed, separated with tab
   - relative_power.xlsx *absolute results for all data processed, separated with tab

### Run whole project  :star:
- OPT 1. Run non GUI python program.
   Clone folder named **main_program_no_GUI**, create a new python project in your IDE, 
   change working directory to where your target data located, run **main.py**

- OPT 2. Run GUI program.
   Clone folder named **GUI_program**, import to your IDE, run **main.py**

- OPT 3. Run notebook.
   Download notebook in folder named **notebook**, open any ipynb support tools, for example Jupyterlab
   Import and run notebook to check


### Compile program on other OS
You can download source code under > GUI_Program > final_file > main_GUI_ALL.py
then compile with psgcompiler package :)




### Program interface and functionality

![main_interface.png](main_interface.png)
- Browse: Open file explorer to select folder contains target edf files
- Preview Selected : select a file and click to view results, show in right frame
- Save Selected: Save the results of current file after preview results generated by program
- Process All Files: Process all data under selected folder and generate results
